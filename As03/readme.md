# APROACHES
We have use these following 3 techniques:

* SVM
* Linear Regression
* MultinomialNB

# DESCRIPTION
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets. We start by acquiring the training and testing datasets into Pandas DataFrames. We also combine these datasets to run certain operations on both datasets together. To confirm some of our observations and assumptions, we can quickly analyze our feature correlations by pivoting features against each other. We can only do so at this stage for features which do not have any empty values. It also makes sense doing so only for features which are categorical (Sex), ordinal (Pclass) or discrete (SibSp, Parch) type.

# ALL TECHNIQUES DESCRIPTION:
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It's used to predict values within a continuous range. Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). ... Naive Bayes classifier is a collection of many algorithms where all the algorithms share one common principle, and that is each feature being classified is not related to any other feature.

 # ACCURACY
We have got 0.76794 accuray.
